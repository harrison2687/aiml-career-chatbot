## Functionality

This chatbot helps career advisors by providing a reference to computer science/IT jobs to students.  The bot helps students in one of two ways: providing a top ten list and guiding the student through a questionaire.  Career information is provided by linking to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the student and choose to learn more about a field by clicking on a button corresponding to the field in question.  If the student isn't quite sure what field they are interested in, they can go through a guided questionaire where the chatbot goes through a list of questions.  The student can interact by answering "yes" or "no," or by clicking on buttons when prompted.
